# Bootstrap 4 Material theme for Known publishing platform

Based on https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design

![theme preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tincho/KnownBootstrapMaterial/master/preview.png)

## Features 

* Bootstrap 4 instead of 3.

* Heavy template replacement, and some extending. So maybe it'll have to be kept up-to-date with Known's changes over time.
** Both Known's core plugins (StaticPages) as well as non-core plugins get extended/replaced, ("Apply to join", "Lightbox", "Github"). 

* Ekko-Lightbox newest version.

* I also added some JS code to modify DOM attributes (classes mostly) where I didn't want to create a whole template replacement (maybe I should have done more of this instead).

## Related plugins

At the same time I worked on this theme I also developed some plugins like "CustomFilter", "MediaGallery" (based on PhotoIndex), "Contact Form", "Video" (I didn't write this one but it says unmantained so maybe adopt it) so probably all of them may have some relation with this theme.
